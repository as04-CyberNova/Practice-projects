1. Simple Login Form:- This project is a beginner-friendly login form built with HTML5 and CSS3 that utilizes Flexbox to achieve a clean, centered layout. It features a simple user interface with dedicated fields for email and password entry, focusing on core concepts such as the CSS box model and basic input styling. Developed as a learning exercise for structuring forms and centering elements, future versions of the project are intended to include improved responsiveness, CSS animations, and JavaScript-based form validation.
