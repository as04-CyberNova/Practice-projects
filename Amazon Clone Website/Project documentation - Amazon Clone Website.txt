Project Documentation – Amazon Clone Website

Hello, today I am going to describe my ongoing project titled “Amazon Clone Website.” This project is a full user interface clone created using HTML5, CSS3, and Flexbox.

The website includes the following components:

1. Navigation bar
2. Navigation panels
3. Background section
4. Shopping section
5. Footer panel

While working on this project, I have learned more about Flexbox and how useful it is for creating responsive and well-structured layouts using HTML5 and CSS3. At present, the project is 65% complete, and I plan to finish the remaining 35% in the coming days.

This project required a significant amount of time and effort. During development, I encountered several errors, and resolving them often took more time than expected. At times, this was challenging and a little discouraging, but it also helped me improve my problem-solving skills and understanding of web development.
